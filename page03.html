	<p>NEPPU! NEPPU!</p>
	
	<p>This game. This game is one of the most entertaining pieces of game literature that I have ever experienced.</p>
	
	<p>The numerous third-wall breaking by the main character, Neptune, and the female andromorphic personifications of 
	the three great consoles made for a very entertaining plot that kept me playing this game straight for a whole weekend.</p>
	
	<p>This game, before this third release, used to look like it was still in the beta-stages, due to the almost cheap 
	look it had back then. But in this new installment, Hyperdimension Neptunia V, the amazing and entertaining plot and setting 
	was mixed in with better gameplay, sound, and even graphics!</p>
	
	<p>I... There are simply no words I can use anymore. I will just simply state. Get a copy. Try it. Enjoy. This game 
	literally entertained me, and had me laughing at many points during gameplay. It helped me relieve stress, and even forget some 
	troubles. Seriously. Try it.</p>
